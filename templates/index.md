   <br/> <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p class="text">
        The Harvard College Asian Student Arts Project is a student-run organization that aims to provide the community 
        and resources for Pan-Asian and Asian-American student artists to make, celebrate, and discuss art
        including (but not limited to) theater, film, dance, music, comedy, writing, entertainment, media, and the visual arts.
        ASAP aims to celebrate the community, experience, culture, and history of Asian students at Harvard with
        events such as workshops, open mic nights, group outings, panels, and large- and small-scale productions and
        performances.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The Asian Student Arts Project will produce at least one artistic project that concerns Asian or Asian-American 
        culture, experiences, history, and/or arts each year.
