            If an officer is unable to complete their term, an impromptu election will be held to replace them, 
            excluding current officers (with the exception of the President, who will be replaced by the 
            Vice President when they are unable to complete their duties as President). In the case of a tie, 
            a discussion without the nominees will be held, followed by a re-vote. If the nominees choose, 
            they may work as co-officers in each position, with a maximum of two officers per position.
